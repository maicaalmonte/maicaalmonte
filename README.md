**🕸️my website:** 
<br>
<br> 🏃‍♀️deployed my website using the free peasant version, so some lagging is expected
<br> 🧍‍♀️i'll improve the layout and add more features over time. but, dont get your hopes up
<br> 🧘‍♀️this is just the byproduct of my overthinking and dissociative brain cells during a lucid interval
<br> 🤸‍♀️so, nothing is seriously serious here — just a pure hobby
<br> 👩‍🦯be creating multiple mediocre websites (not even half as mediocre), trying out different APIs until i find a better project to fixate on
<br> 🧎‍♀️also, still not a pro at this yet
<br> 💁‍♀️just me overexplaining
